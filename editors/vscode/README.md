# zfls for VS Code

Fortran language support powered by
[zfls](https://github.com/cesiumlang/zfls), a fast native reimplementation
of the [fortls](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortls) language server:

- completion, hover, signature help
- go to definition and implementation, find references, rename
- document and workspace symbols
- diagnostics
- syntax highlighting for free-form and fixed-form Fortran, with OpenMP and
  OpenACC directives
- snippets for program units and constructs (see [Snippets](#snippets))
- breakpoints in Fortran files, for debuggers such as C/C++ (cppdbg,
  cppvsdbg) and CodeLLDB
- a Fortran file icon, in file icon themes that use the language's icon

The extension includes the `zfls` executable for Windows, Linux and macOS
(x64 and ARM64). Nothing else needs to be installed.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zfls.path` | empty | A `zfls` to run instead of the bundled one |
| `zfls.arguments` | `["--incremental_sync", "--use_signature_help", "--enable_code_actions", "--hover_signature"]` | Command-line arguments; zfls accepts the same options as fortls (`zfls --help`). The default turns on signature help, code actions and signatures in hover, as Modern Fortran does |
| `zfls.disableModernFortranCheck` | `false` | Do not offer to turn off Modern Fortran's fortls |
| `zfls.trace.server` | `off` | Log the language server messages in the `zfls` output channel |

As with fortls, a `.fortlsrc`, `.fortls.json` or `.fortls` file in the
workspace root configures source directories, preprocessor definitions and
other options.

## Using it with Modern Fortran

zfls registers the same Fortran language IDs as the
[Modern Fortran](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fortran-lang.linter-gfortran)
extension, so the two work together. Modern Fortran also starts fortls,
though; when both are installed, zfls offers to turn that off
(`fortran.fortls.disabled`), leaving Modern Fortran's other features, such
as linting with a compiler, in place.

## Snippets

Type a prefix and pick the snippet from the completion list:

| Prefix | Inserts |
| --- | --- |
| `program`, `module`, `submodule` | A program unit with `implicit none` |
| `fun`, `sub` | A function with a result variable, a subroutine |
| `interface`, `abstract` | An interface block, an abstract interface |
| `typ`, `typc`, `proc` | A derived type with `contains`, a type with a type-bound procedure, a type-bound procedure binding |
| `if`, `ife`, `el`, `else` | A one-line `if`, an `if` block, an `if`/`else` block, `else if` and `else` branches |
| `do`, `dow`, `doc` | `do`, `do while` and `do concurrent` loops |
| `selc`, `selt` | `select case`, `select type` |
| `block`, `associate`, `where`, `enum` | Those constructs |
| `imp` | `implicit none` |
| `modoc` | A module documentation header |

The fixed-form snippets indent with spaces and keep every line at the
column where the prefix was typed, so type the prefix at column 7 or later.
Most snippets are adapted from those of Modern Fortran.
